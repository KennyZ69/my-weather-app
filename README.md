After watching a few vids about this kind of thing i tried to built this weather app.
It took a bit of time but I built it, it works, learnt a bit about async a fetch etc...
Ofc I didnt came up with everything unfortunately, I had been ,,Inspired";


Idk if it will work as a website with typescript as the script... It is built with Bun and vite server also, 
So run --> bun run dev
to start a localhost vite server;
